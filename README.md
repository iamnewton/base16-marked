## Where to Find Documentation

The best way to find out what's available is to dig through source code, as each directory has a README file to describe each feature.

## How We Track Changes [![Keep a Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keep%20a%20Changelog-1.0.0-orange)](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

This project uses a CHANGELOG and [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. [Read more about changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## How We Version [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for its versioning providing us an opt-in approach to releases. This means we add a version number according to the spec, as you see below. So rather than force developers to consume the latest and greatest, they can choose which version to consume and test any newer ones before upgrading. Please the read the spec as it goes into further detail.

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
